<h3>Technologies Used</h3>

  --HTML<br />
  --CSS<br />
  --SASS<br />
  --JavaScript<br />
  -- jQuery<br />
  --AJAX<br />
  --Game and User API<br />

<h3>Planning</h3>

I began this project by building the GUI in HTML and SASS. Then I built the user authentication forms for sign-up/in/out and change password. After authenticaion was verified as working I built the game logic for interactions with the game board and user, while updating the UI accordingly. My main goal for this project was to try to keep the code as modular as possible by keeping UI functions, AJAX calls, and logic functions seperate. Even small helper functions to display a message to the were placed inside of ui.js. My main strategizing was done during the authentication process. I first built curl scripts to test my request format before implementing it in the application itself.


<h3>Future Versions</h3>

As I havent run into any unsolved problems, I would like to some how return a record (wins and losses) for the user. As of right now I would have to loop through the game board on each game in the server and determine whether or the not the game was won or lost by the user.


<h3>User Stories</h3>

-- As an avid user, I want to be able to sign into an account so I can view my game history.<br />
-- As a new user, I want a clean, responsive UI so that I am not distracted by unnecessary UI elements.<br />
-- As a social user, I want to be able to play games over the internet so that I can play with my friends.<br />
-- As a competitive user, I want be able to see a leaderboard so I can see where I rank among others.<br />
-- As an inexperienced user, I want to be able to see helpful prompts while playing the game.<br />
